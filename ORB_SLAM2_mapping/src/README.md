This is the implementation of our paper: "Building Maps for Autonomous Navigation Using Sparse Visual SLAM Features" in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2017. Our implementation is built on the top of the open-source stereo SLAM [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). It runs in ROS （developed in version of indigo）. Eigen, OpenCV, and CGAL are needed.

(720p is recommmanded)

To run this code, complie it with ROS in linux system, and type:

rosrun light_mapping ros_stereo_kitti 

It will read the configuration file in the config folder, such as KITTI05.yaml. Please adjust it accordingly to your environment.
